# **User Engagement Analysis **

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of user engagement data, leveraging Python for data preprocessing and analysis and Power BI for creating interactive dashboards.
The goal is to derive actionable insights from user activity patterns, content preferences, and engagement behavior.

---

## **Project Overview**

The project focuses on analyzing user engagement data to understand:
- The types of content users interact with the most.
- Daily active user trends.
- User activity distribution by hour and region.
- Key metrics like session duration, clicks, and total time spent.

The final deliverable is an interactive Power BI dashboard alongside a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the data analysis process.
